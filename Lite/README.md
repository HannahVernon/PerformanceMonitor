# Performance Monitor Lite

Lightweight, agentless SQL Server performance monitoring desktop application. Monitors multiple SQL Server instances from a single dashboard without installing anything on target servers. Queries DMVs directly over the network and stores data locally in DuckDB with automatic Parquet archival.

Includes an embedded MCP server for exposing monitoring data to LLM clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) via the Model Context Protocol.

Best for quick triage, Azure SQL Database, restricted environments, and consultant use.

See the [root README](../README.md) for full documentation.
