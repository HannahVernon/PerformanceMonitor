# Performance Monitor CLI Installer

Self-contained console application that installs the PerformanceMonitor database, 29 collector stored procedures, reporting views, and SQL Agent jobs on a target SQL Server instance. Supports both interactive prompts and command-line arguments for automated deployment.

No .NET installation required on the target machine — the executable includes the full .NET 8.0 runtime.
